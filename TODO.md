# For next version

* Add class description to `R/htest_boot-class.R`
* Is there more to be done generalising htest_boot?  Should it be a separate package?
* Faster alternative to base R `rank` as that is the bootstrapping bottleneck
* Is travis-ci.org a solution for continual integration?
* Include link to CRAN package passing stats, along with other tags, as is visible in e.g., https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/matrixStats
