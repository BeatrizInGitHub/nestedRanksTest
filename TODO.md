# For 1.0

* can the README be generated from say the vignette?  vignette needs some editing if so
* add figure to vignette explaining structure in the dataset
* complete the description of the interface (weighting, Z-score, bootstrap)
* how to actually run/view a vignette?
* more tests
* can the bootstrapping be sped up?
* can we add a trigger that does `make doc` before any `git commit`, to automatically keep the `man/*.Rd` files up to date?
* keywords etc. to get it in a CRAN view for this kind of test
* submit to CRAN
