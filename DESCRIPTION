Title: Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test When Observations Are Grouped
Version: 0.1
Author: Douglas G. Scofield
Maintainer: Douglas G. Scofield <douglasgscofield@gmail.com>
Description: Perform a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test using nested ranks. Used when data are structured into several groups and each group has received both treatments. The rankings are compared between treatment levels while taking group structure and size into account, using a null distribution constructed by permuting ranks assuming no influence of treatment.  When there is just one group, this test is identical to a standard MWW test.
