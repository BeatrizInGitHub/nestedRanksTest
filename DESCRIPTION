Title: Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test When Data Are in Groups
Version: 1.0
Author: Douglas G. Scofield
Maintainer: Douglas G. Scofield <douglasgscofield@gmail.com>
Description: Calculate a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for a difference between treatment levels using nested ranks.  This test can be used when observations are structured into several groups and each group has received both treatment levels. The p-value is determined via bootstrapping.  This test is intended to be analogous to a mixed-model extension of the wilcox.test, for which treatment is a fixed effect and group membership is a random effect.
