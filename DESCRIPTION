Description: Calculate a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test using nested ranks.  Data are structured into several groups and each group has received two treatment levels. The rankings are compared between treatment levels, taking group structure and size into account.  A null distribution is constructed by permuting ranks, assuming no influence of treatment.  When there is just one group, this test is identical to a standard MWW test.
